# Splix

Splix is a command-line tool written in Rust for splitting images into multiple images based on specified rows, columns, or a custom grid. It offers a simple and efficient way to break down images into smaller components, facilitating various image processing tasks.

Disclaimer: first time writing Rust so code might be terrible

Future: 
- variable row heights and col widths
- grid of any combination of row heights/widths
